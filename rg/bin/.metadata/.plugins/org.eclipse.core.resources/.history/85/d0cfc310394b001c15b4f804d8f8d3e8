               * did not call it.
               * but problems occur when there are
               * multiple constructors known as  I
               * constructor over loading.
               * But can there be multiple cntructors
               * of same class?
               * no,multiple constructors of same class 
               * can only be used if they have different 
               * parameters as ashown above.
